In a paragraph identify the key stakeholders for the project using the class slides from the lecture. 5 points.

key stakeholders would be students, viewers of the website

	The two main stakeholders for a portfolio website would be students having a showcase for their work and viewers of the website browsing other's work. Having a simple website to display a student's work through school or extracurricular actives would be a benefit for any college applicant or an online location to store your achievements. A viewer would like an easy to navigate and pleasing website so they spend as much time looking around. The student would also want these things for the viewer as that is their intended audience and likely in their best interest.
